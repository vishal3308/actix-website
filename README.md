# Actix Website

The work in progress website for the actix project based on tokio's website.

## Getting Started

Building the website depends on [Hugo]. So, first make sure
that you have it installed. If on macOS and using [Homebrew], run the following:

```sh
brew update
brew install hugo
```

Then, get the website running locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/actix/actix-website.git
cd actix-website

hugo server
```

Then visit http://localhost:1313.

## Updating diagrams

Diagrams are located under [/static/css/img/diagrams/](https://github.com/actix/actix-website/tree/master/static/img/diagrams) and built with [Mermaid CLI].

For instance to edit `connection_overview` diagram:

```sh
cd static/css/img/diagrams
vi connection_overview.mmd
# Compile diagrams:
mmdc -i connection_overview.mmd -o connection_overview.svg
```

# License (must read)

Pretty murky. Right now a massive clone of the tokio website. Will get this
figured out as we go along.
